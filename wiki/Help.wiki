1. Please be aware of the different between blogbus Old Themes System and the new one. If you cannot implement the downloaded themes in one system, try another one.<br/>
2. Unzip the themes you want, and paste the source code to these<br/>
corresponding modules. This http://bangzhuzhongxin.blogbus.com/logs/4519414 html will help you to do this.<br/>
3. Right click, "Open with...", Notepad to open the html or css file in the package.<br/>
4. You can modify the Index and Log modules (in old system), or Index and Detail modules (in new system) to specify yourself's link in the navigation.<br/>
5. If you are implementing a 3 columns theme in the new system, you can do the 2 step first. And adjust the sidebar(1) and sidebar(2) into what you want.<br/>
